When DownloadHelper detects embedded videos it can access for download, the toolbar icon highlights and a simple menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item.\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with most other popular video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe, and thousands of others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, HLS, DASH, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is able to capture the media directly from the screen and generate a video file.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also capable of making file conversions (i.e. change audio and video formats) and aggregation (combining separate audio and video into a single file). This is an upgrade feature that helps pay for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from websites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nVideo overview on how to use Video DownloadHelper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZT8yI60k_4\n\nSupport can be obtained from the dedicated support forum.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), or Facebook.","weeklyDownloads":136293,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/32479/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?modified=1543518772","width":200,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?modified=1543518772","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?modified=1543518772","width":327,"height":124,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.png?modified=1543518772","thumbnailWidth":327,"thumbnailHeight":124,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?modified=1543518773","width":250,"height":200,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.png?modified=1543518773","thumbnailWidth":250,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?modified=1543518774","width":361,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.png?modified=1543518774","thumbnailWidth":361,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?modified=1543518774","width":320,"height":317,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.png?modified=1543518774","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?modified=1543518775","width":293,"height":250,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.png?modified=1543518775","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":250,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2801,"reviewCount":16196,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/","updateDate":1562545565000},{"id":"https-everywhere@eff.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"HTTPS Everywhere","version":"2019.11.7","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3442258/https_everywhere-2019.11.7-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere","supportURL":"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere","description":"Encrypt the web!

Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":5030,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1693,"reviewCount":915,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1564148560000},{"id":"forecastfox@s3_fix_version","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/583/583250-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/583/583250-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/583/583250-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Forecastfox (fix version)","version":"4.25","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3411646/forecastfox_fix_version-4.25-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"http://www.s3blog.org/forecastfox.html","supportURL":"http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=2913287","description":"Get international weather updates (via AccuWeather.com) displayed right in Firefox with this highly customizable extension.","fullDescription":"What is Forecastfox?\nGet international weather updates (via AccuWeather.com) displayed right in Firefox with this highly customizable extension.\n\nForecastfox features:\n\n    Vertical and horizontal displays\n    Select multiple “favorite” locations\n    Set your preferred units of measurement (Fahrenheit, Celcius, or custom)\n    Dozens of weather icon styles to choose from\n    Designate pages to hide the forecast bar\n    Select the number of days you want a weather forecast\n    Lots of fine detail settings like info on humidity, wind, precipitation, visibility & more\n\n\n\nWebExtensions Limitations:\n\n    Forecast bar will not be displayed on some sites from mozilla.org and google.com\n    Forecast bar will not be displayed on sites that do not have pages, for example error 404 (page not found)\n    Forecast bar will not be displayed on internal Firefox and GoogleChrome pages, for example about:addons , about:config , chrome://extensions/ , chrome://settings/ , etc.\n    Forecast bar will not be displayed on the WebExtensions pages \"moz-extension://....\" , \"chrome-extension://....\"\n    Forecast bar may not be displayed correctly on some sites.
